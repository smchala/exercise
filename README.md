As a guide this test should take approximately 2 hours.

A cinema requires a new ticketing system to be used in their shiny new app. There are two types of ticket:

● Standard: £7.90

● Concession: £5.40

In addition, there are a few extras which can be added to some tickets:

● Real3D: £0.90

● IMAX: £1.50

The Cinema also wants to have special offers that are applied automatically. A specific offer they would like to include from the start is:

● Three for One Thursdays (buy one get two free for tickets purchased on Thursdays)

Ticket Totaling

Your task is to implement a checkout system that can calculate the total cost of a combination of tickets that a user might buy using the app. Bear in mind:

● Tickets can be added in any order

● Offers should always be applied if possible

● The cinema owner would like to be able to show the customer how much they saved when offers have been applied

● New types of pricing/offers may need to be added in the future
